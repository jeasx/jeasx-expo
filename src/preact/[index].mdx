# Preact in Jeasx with state & signals

[Preact](https://preactjs.com) empowers you to enhance your server-rendered JSX application by embedding interactive islands of UI. With support for state management and reactive signals, your components can efficiently communicate and synchronize across the page, delivering a fast and dynamic user experience.

<details>
<summary>How to integrate Preact with Jeasx?</summary>
First you have to install the required dependencies for Preact via npm:

```bash
npm install @preact/signals preact preact-render-to-string
```

As Preact requires a dedicated JSX runtime, you have to configure it via a `tsconfig.json` for the directories where you want to compile Preact to JavaScript:

```json
{
  "extends": "jeasx/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsxImportSource": "preact"
  },
  "include": ["**/*"]
}
```

Please visit the [source code at GitHub](https://github.com/jeasx/jeasx-expo) to see how to setup Preact in detail.

## Jokes

The widget below handles reactivity via manipulating state.

<Preact component="Jokes" api="/jokes/api" initial={3} />

## Clocks

Both clocks are synchronized via a common signal. You can use this pattern to create interactive islands which share a common state.

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction:row; gap:2rem; justify-content: center;">
  <Preact component="Clock" locale="en-US" />
  <Preact component="Clock" locale="de-DE" />
</div>

</Layout>
