          I am aware that false, incomplete or delayed information, evidence and
          documents can lead to a loss of insurance coverage, to the extent that
          they are relevant to the determination of the insurance claim or the
          insurance company's obligation to provide benefits.

        <Paragraph>
          In the event of intentional false, incomplete or delayed information,
          evidence and documents, the insurance company may be entitled to
          refuse to provide benefits. If the breach is due to gross negligence,
          the insurance company may be entitled to reduce its benefits in a
          proportionate manner, up to a complete loss of the claim.
